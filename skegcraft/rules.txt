All players on Skegcraft must agree to these rules.

Skegcraft Rules:
- Don't build senseless crap (lavacasts)
- No vulgar crap
- Don't build death traps.
- No lag machines. If something you made lags the server, and you don't fix
  it within a week, it will be seized. Any attempt to resist will result in permanent ban.
- Don't use hacked clients, (no xray, hacks, or anything *dishonest*).
  Things like Optifine are obviously fine.
- Don't duplicate items.
- Don't take advantage of major glitches
  (nether roof is allowed, since it is endorsed by Mojang)
- Use common sense, and don't act like an 8 year old.
  And if you are 8, you should not be on my server,
  go back to playing legos and drinking your juice box.

Minecraft Server Etiquette:
 Good practice, but you won't get immediately banned if you don't follow it.
- If a creeper blows somebody's stuff next to you, *at least* try to fix it.
  In the very least, you need to notify the owner.
- Respect things made by other people.
- Refrain from using curse words. If you absolutely cannot because
  of muscle memory in your fingers, you need to find a therapist.

Admin rules:
- You can only ban if somebody breaks the rules.
- Infinite ban should only be used after 1 two week ban.
- Keep plugin count to an absolute minimum
- Do everything in your power to keep a vanilla/unmodified experience
- Absolutely no cheats
- When making decisions, do a community vote.
