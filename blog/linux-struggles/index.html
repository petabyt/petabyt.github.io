	<div class='post' title='Post #19'><h1>The Struggle of Moving to Linux</h1><p>October 17, 2019</p><p>I have been using Windows for pretty much all my life. I remember using Windows XP in elementary school, with huge CRT monitors and Kid Pix. I have been using it for long over a decade now, and I have recently decided to switch.</p>
<hr>
<p>For about a month I have been migrating from Windows 10 to Ubuntu MATE. It's not an easy process, but it's worth it. I love the MATE desktop, it has just the right amount of classic and modern. I still boot up Windows every now and then just to play a game (BeamNG.Drive, mostly), but the majority of my work is now being done in my new OS.</p>
<p>Even though the switch was definitely a good decision, there are still some things I miss about using Windows. Here are some examples:</p>
<h2>Software Support</h2>
<p>A lot of software, especially games, run solely on Windows. For example, Rufus, a USB drive writing software I use often, only runs on Windows. I was disappointed to find out about this, since it had many features that other alternatives didn't. Also, this does not have anything to do with open-source software.</p>
<h2>Fixing Problems</h2>
<p>For some reason, whenever I had an issue with Windows, I could easily search it up on the internet and quickly find a solution. With Linux and the countless distros out there, finding help on small issues seems almost impossible. I still have several small problems that I've never been able to fix.</p>
<h2>Admin/User</h2>
<p>I've heard countless people say, "In Windows, you are a user. In Linux, you are the Admin". When I switched, I didn't feel like an admin no more than I did on Windows. A lot of the files I create in Linux, I have to give myself permission to edit, which completely contradicted what people said. It might just be my file manager, but this is definitely something that annoys me.</p>
<p>There are many things I wish people told me about Linux before I started using it. I have tried other Linux distros, but Ubuntu MATE is the only one that just felt right. I still hate Windows 10, with it's bloated core and how it's extremely slow.</p></div><a class='back' href='.'>Back</a>
